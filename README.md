Recidivism, or the likelihood of an individual returning to prison after release, is a major challenge faced by the United States criminal justice system. High rates of recidivism lead to overcrowded prisons, increased costs, and negative impacts on individuals and society. To address this challenge, we are undertaking a project that aims to use machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of recidivism and identify factors that contribute to it.
To achieve this goal, we will use five different classifiers - Weka, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Net, and Naive Bayes - to build predictive models. Each of these algorithms has its own strengths and weaknesses and is suited to different types of data and tasks. By using a variety of classifiers, we can compare their performance and identify which one works best for our specific dataset and task.
In addition to using different classifiers, we will experiment with different attribute selection methods. Attribute selection is the process of identifying which variables in our dataset are most relevant to our predictive task. By removing irrelevant or redundant variables, we can simplify our model and improve its accuracy. We will compare the performance of our classifiers using different attribute selection methods to determine which one works best for our specific dataset and task.
To ensure the best results for our predictive models, we will also employ a 10-fold cross-validation technique. This involves randomly partitioning our dataset into 10 equally-sized subsets, training our classifiers on 9 of the subsets, and testing their performance on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset being used once as the test set. The results from the 10 runs are then averaged to obtain a more accurate estimate of the model's performance.
Overall, our project aims to use a variety of techniques, including five different classifiers, different attribute selection methods, and 10-fold cross-validation, to build accurate and robust p redictive models of recidivism in the United States. By doing so, we hope to contribute to efforts to reduce recidivism rates and improve the criminal justice system.
